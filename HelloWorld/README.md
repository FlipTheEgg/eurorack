# HelloWorld

WIP

Hello World! As the name might suggest this is my first time... doing several things. While this is hardware and not software, it's still my first time:
 - Using KiCad
 - Making a eurorack module
 - Making something usable enough to give to someone (or maybe even sell)
 
I learned a lot in the process of making this, and I wanted to document those experiences - for myself as well as others that could be interested in learning the same. 

If you're just here to make the module, go ahead and skip to [Can I make this?](https://github.com/FlipTheEgg/eurorack/tree/master/HelloWorld#can-i-make-this).
 
 ## How did I  do it?

I wanted to start out simple, so I chose a schematic i *completely* understood: a simple mixer with a volume control. 

My goal over time is to simultaneously design more sophisticated PCBs, and learn about more advanced circuits as I go.

## What did I learn?

Measure twice: Building the PCB before the panel is bad.
File structure and you: This repository is a mess.

## Can I make this?
Yeah, go ahead. Send the gerber zip files to JLCPCB or someone else, and read the BOM to find out what parts you need, and order them somewhere.
