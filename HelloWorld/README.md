# HelloWorld

WIP

Hello World! This is a three-channel eurorack mixer, but more importantly, as the name might suggest, this is my first time doing several things. It's my first time
 - Using KiCad
 - Making a eurorack module
 - Making something usable enough to give to someone (or maybe even sell)
 
I learned a lot in the process of making this, and I wanted to document those experiences - for myself as well as others that could be interested in learning the same. 

If you're just here to make the module, go ahead and skip to [Can I make this?](https://github.com/FlipTheEgg/eurorack/tree/master/HelloWorld#can-i-make-this).
 
 ## How did I  do it?

I wanted to start out simple, so I chose a schematic i *completely* understood: a simple mixer with a volume control. The challenge with this project wasn't circuit design, but rather learning KiCad and designing to the specifications of Eurorack. My goal over time is to simultaneously design more sophisticated PCBs, and learn about more advanced circuits as I go.

## What did I learn?

Measure twice: Building the PCB before the panel is bad.
File structure and you: This repository is a mess.

## Can I make this?
Yeah, go ahead. Send the gerber zip files to JLCPCB or someone else, and read the BOM to find out what parts you need, and order them somewhere.
